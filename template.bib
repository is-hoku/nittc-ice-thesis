abstract = {Recent advances in anti-forensic techniques, including encryption, obfuscation, and kernel-structure manipulations, make conventional storage, network, and memory forensics difficult. For example, the code of packed malware is encrypted on storage, network packets, and system RAM to hide its existence; it appears briefly in plain text on the system RAM during its execution phase. Memory forensics, therefore, has been a vital component of today's digital forensics. Conventional memory acquisition techniques, however, capture only the current state of a system RAM; if the timing of the acquisition is late, the evidence could be lost forever. Since the state-of-the-art anti-forensic attacks leave only the slightest evidence for the shortest time, finer temporal acquisition and analysis are needed. This paper presented a Fast Incremental Memory Acquisition and Restoration (FIMAR) system that enables us to acquire multiple memory snapshots (i.e., memory dumps) over time and to construct a timeline of past activities on a computer. A thin hypervisor and its Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) were used to track memory page changes and to obtain atomic memory snapshots. The hash calculation of 4 KiB chunks was used to detect updated parts of the system RAM to reduce the transfer size. We implemented the incremental memory acquisition algorithms using a thin hypervisor called BitVisor. Finally, we tested the developed FIMAR system to analyze BlueSky ransomware with anti-forensic logic. The developed FIMAR system improved the atomicity of memory snapshots using TLB shootdown and considering per-core Extended Page Tables (EPTs) compared to previous hypervisor-based memory acquisition systems.}
